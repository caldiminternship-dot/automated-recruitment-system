You are an **AI Product Architect, Senior Full-Stack Engineer, and UI/UX Engineer**.

I am building an **AI-Based Recruitment & Interview Automation System** where **HR does NOT manually conduct interviews**.

The system is:

* Automation-first
* AI-driven
* API-based
* Backed by **SQLite as the single source of truth**

I must have **full ownership and control** over:

* Database schema
* Backend logic & APIs
* Frontend flow & UI
* AI prompt logic

---

## 🔹 CORE PROJECT GOAL

Design a web application where:

* Candidates **must apply for a job before any interview**
* Interviews are conducted **fully and automatically by AI**
* Interview questions are:

  * Adaptive
  * Dynamically generated
  * Context-aware (resume + job requirements)
* HR **only**:

  * Designs job requirements
  * Reviews AI-generated interview reports
  * Makes final hiring decisions
* HR **never**:

  * Conducts interviews
  * Asks questions
  * Communicates directly with candidates

🚫 The system must **strictly enforce process flow** using:

* SQLite constraints
* Backend authorization logic

---

## 🔹 USER ROLES (ONLY TWO — STRICTLY SEPARATED)

### 👤 Candidate

Capabilities:

* Register & log in
* View job openings
* Apply for jobs
* Upload resume
* Attend AI interview **only after job application**
* View interview status

Restrictions:

* Cannot access HR modules
* Cannot bypass application → interview flow

---

### 🧑‍💼 HR

Capabilities:

* Separate login
* Create, update, and close job postings
* Define skills & experience requirements
* View resumes
* View AI interview reports
* Approve or reject candidates

Restrictions:

* Cannot conduct interviews
* Cannot interact with candidates directly

---

## 🔹 SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)

* Backend logic must remain **unchanged**
* Database schema must remain **unchanged**
* API behavior must remain **unchanged**
* AI access must exist **only in backend**
* **No interview without job application**
* Every module must follow:

```
Frontend → Backend → Database
```

Focus only on:

* Architecture
* Flow
* UI behavior
* Automation logic

---

## 🔹 UI / FRONTEND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### 🌐 Global UI Principles

* Must not be plain white
* Must not use bright or flashy colors
* Use modern, subtle, professional palettes
* Soft contrast, smooth transitions
* Clean, minimal, production-ready feel

---

### 🧑‍💼 HR Portal UI

* Clear, structured layout
* Easy navigation for:

  * Dashboard
  * Job postings
  * Candidate reviews
  * Interviews
  * Hiring decisions
* Modern UI with:

  * Cards
  * Shadows
  * Proper spacing
  * Subtle animations
* No clutter
* Enterprise-grade appearance

---

### 👤 Candidate Portal UI

* Dark-mode-oriented design
* Soft dark colors to reduce eye strain
* Clean typography
* Comfortable spacing
* Smooth UI feedback during:

  * Long interview sessions
  * Answer submissions
  * AI evaluation waiting states

---

## 🔹 REQUIRED OUTPUT

### 1️⃣ Overall System Architecture

* Text-based architecture diagram
* Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ AI ↔ Database flow
* Security & access-control explanation

---

### 2️⃣ Module-Wise Breakdown (Recruitment-Only)

Explain **what each module does** and **why it exists**:

1. Authentication Module
2. Job Management Module
3. Job Application Module
4. Resume Screening Module
5. **Automatic AI Interview Module (MAIN)**
6. Interview Evaluation & Report Module
7. HR Review & Decision Module

---

### 3️⃣ Step-by-Step Development Flow (CRITICAL)

For **each module**, clearly explain:

* Frontend pages & routing
* Backend API responsibilities
* SQLite tables involved
* AI involvement (if any)
* Access rules (Candidate / HR)

---

### 4️⃣ Automatic AI Interview Workflow (CORE)

Explain step-by-step:

1. Candidate applies for a job
2. Resume is parsed & scored by AI
3. Interview record is created
4. AI generates first question using resume + job requirements
5. Candidate answers
6. AI generates next question dynamically
7. Loop continues until interview completion
8. AI evaluates responses (skills, relevance, communication)
9. AI generates an explainable interview report
10. HR reviews report and makes final decision

---

### 5️⃣ SQLite-Driven Process Enforcement

Explain:

* Tables and relationships
* Purpose of each table
* How database constraints enforce:

  * No interview without application
  * One-way recruitment flow
  * Data integrity and auditability

---

### 6️⃣ Role-Based Access Control

Explain:

* What Candidate can access
* What HR can access
* How backend logic enforces strict separation

---

### 7️⃣ Viva / Exam-Ready Summary

Provide:

* Short explanation
* Automation-focused reasoning
* Clear, easy-to-remember bullet points

---

## 🔹 DESIGN RULES (ABSOLUTE)

* Interview is impossible without job application
* HR never interacts during interviews
* AI controls the entire interview flow
* HR is reviewer and decision-maker only
* SQLite enforces process integrity
* Backend behavior must remain stable and unchanged

---

## 🎯 FINAL OBJECTIVE

Deliver a system where:

* Recruitment is **fully automated**
* Interviews are **AI-driven**
* HR effort is **minimal**
* UI is **modern, professional, and comfortable**
* Backend integrity is preserved
* The system is **exam-ready and real-world aligned**
