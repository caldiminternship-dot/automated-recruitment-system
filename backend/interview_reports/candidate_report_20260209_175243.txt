    • None
  Areas for Improvement:
    • The answer lacks any technical information, does not address the question, and shows no understanding of the topic. The response is also extremely brief and does not provide any examples or structure.
    • Note: The answer "sorry i dont know how to answer poda dei" does not demonstrate any knowledge or effort to address the question, resulting in the lowest possible scores across all categories. A more constructive response would be to ask for clarification or provide a partial answer, even if the candidate is unsure.

----------------------------------------

QUESTION 4
Question: Using Angular, create a simple directive that applies a CSS class to an element when the user hovers over it, and then removes the class when the user stops hovering. How would you implement this directive, and what are the key considerations for accessibility and performance?

  Completeness: 1/10
  Clarity: 2.0/10
  Depth: 1.0/10
  Practicality: 1.0/10
  Strengths:
    • None
  Areas for Improvement:
    • Lack of technical knowledge, unprofessional tone and response.
    • The answer does not provide any technical information, and the candidate admits to not knowing anything about Angular. The response is also unprofessional and defensive, which is not suitable for a technical interview. The ideal answer should provide a clear and concise explanation of how to create a directive in Angular, along with considerations for accessibility and performance.

    • Note: The answer does not meet any of the expected criteria for a technical interview response. It is unprofessional, incomplete, and lacks technical accuracy, clarity, depth, and practicality. A more suitable response would provide a specific example of an unexpected challenge, explain the steps taken to resolve it, and demonstrate a professional tone and language.
