QUESTION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

Question 1: Explain the difference between authentication and authorization. Can you give an example of where you would implement each in a typical web application?
Score: 1.7/10
  Technical Accuracy: 1.5/10
  Completeness: 2.0/10
  Clarity: 2.0/10
  Depth: 1.0/10
  Practicality: 2.0/10
  Strengths:
    - The answer is grammatically coherent and defines authentication and authorization correctly, though this is irrelevant to the prompt.
  Areas for Improvement:
    - The answer completely fails to address the question, which asked about REST API error handling, validation, and HTTP status codes. It instead provides a definition of authentication vs. authorization, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of the technical requirements.
----------------------------------------

Question 2: You are designing a REST API endpoint that needs to accept a JSON payload, validate that required fields are present and correctly formatted, and then save the data to a database. Walk me through the steps you would take in your code to handle errors (like invalid data or a database connection failure) and what HTTP status codes you would return to the client in those scenarios.
Score: 9.1/10
  Technical Accuracy: 9.5/10
  Completeness: 9.0/10
  Clarity: 9.0/10
  Depth: 8.0/10
  Practicality: 10/10
  Strengths:
    - The answer correctly identifies the core architectural pattern of decoupling write traffic using a message queue (Kafka) or cache (Redis) to protect the database. It mentions critical concepts like idempotency and eventual consistency, which are essential for a robust design.
  Areas for Improvement:
    - The answer could be slightly more specific about the "thousands of likes per second" constraint by mentioning the trade-off of losing the exact count in real-time (e.g., using a probabilistic counter like HyperLogLog if absolute precision isn't required), though the current approach is perfectly valid. It also briefly mentions "rate-limited" but doesn't clarify if this is per user or global, which is an important distinction.
----------------------------------------

Question 3: Imagine you are building a feature where users can "like" a post. If a post becomes very popular and receives thousands of likes per second, how would you design the system to handle this high write volume without crashing the database?
Score: 8.9/10
  Technical Accuracy: 9.5/10
  Completeness: 9.0/10
  Clarity: 9.0/10
  Depth: 8.0/10
  Practicality: 9.0/10
  Strengths:
    - Excellent structure and real-world context; demonstrates strong separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
  Areas for Improvement:
    - Could provide slightly more technical detail on the "mock API" implementation (e.g., using MSW vs. a simple Express route) or the specific frontend optimization techniques used.
----------------------------------------

Question 4: Tell me about a time when a critical feature you were building in React required a complex, server-side operation that was not yet available in your Node.js/Express API. How did you approach the problem, how did you collaborate with the backend team or manage the API development yourself, and how did you ensure the frontend remained performant and stable while waiting for the backend solution to be implemented?
Score: 8.4/10
  Technical Accuracy: 9.0/10
  Completeness: 8.0/10
  Clarity: 9.0/10
  Depth: 8.0/10
  Practicality: 8.0/10
  Strengths:
    - Excellent coverage of backend reliability mechanisms (atomic transitions, timeouts, retries) and clear definition of state machine logic. The mention of idempotency is a strong, professional detail.
  Areas for Improvement:
    - The answer completely fails to address the second half of the question: "how you communicated those evolving states to the React client to handle the user experience without polling." It mentions the jobId return but ignores the mechanism for pushing updates (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events).
----------------------------------------

Question 5: In your answer, you mentioned evolving the backend from a basic synchronous version to an asynchronous, background-processed flow. Could you detail the specific technical challenges you encountered when managing the state of these asynchronous jobs (e.g., pending, processing, completed, failed) on the backend, and how you communicated those evolving states to the React client to handle the user experience without polling?
Score: 2.9/10
  Technical Accuracy: 3.5/10
  Completeness: 2.0/10
  Clarity: 5.0/10
  Depth: 2.0/10
  Practicality: 2.0/10
  Strengths:
    - The answer correctly identifies the high-level requirements for a lease mechanism (atomic claiming, time-bounding, and reclamation). It uses relevant terminology like "atomic primitives" and "lease."
  Areas for Improvement:
    - The answer is critically incomplete; it cuts off after the introduction and fails to detail the specific primitives (e.g., Lua scripts, SET with NX/EX, ZSETs) or the logic required to implement the mechanism. It remains at a conceptual level without providing the technical implementation details requested by the question.
