      "question": "1. What is the main difference between 2D drafting and 3D modeling in the context of AEC, and how does BIM (Building Information Modeling) fit into this paradigm?",
      "answer": "A **federated model** in BIM is a coordinated collection of separate discipline-specific models (such as architectural, structural, and MEP) that are linked together without being merged into a single file. Each stakeholder maintains ownership and control of their own model while working within shared project standards. These models are combined virtually to detect clashes, check coordination, and understand overall project impact. This approach allows teams to work in parallel, reducing file conflicts and improving accountability. As a result, collaboration becomes more efficient, transparent, and scalable across large, multi-disciplinary construction projects.",

      "question": "2. Can you explain the concept of a \"federated model\" in BIM, and how it facilitates collaboration among different stakeholders in a construction project?",
      "answer": "To create a detailed **structural steel connection in Tekla Structures**, you typically start by accurately modeling the primary and secondary steel members with correct profiles, material grades, and positions. Then, use **Tekla’s built-in connection components** (such as end plate, clip angle, or base plate connections) by selecting the members and adjusting component parameters to define **bolt sizes, bolt spacing, edge distances, weld types, and weld sizes**. For special cases, you can manually add **bolts, welds, plates, and fittings** to fully control the connection geometry and detailing. After modeling, run **clash checks** and review connection behavior in 3D to ensure constructability and compliance with design standards. Best practices include using **standardized components and templates**, maintaining consistent modeling conventions, regularly checking model accuracy with drawings and design inputs, and keeping models well-organized with phases, numbering, and properties to improve efficiency and collaboration.",

    {
      "question": "1. How would you create a detailed structural steel connection in Tekla, including the placement of bolts, welds, and other relevant details, and what are some best practices to ensure accuracy and efficiency?",
      "answer": "To create a **custom AutoCAD block** for an architectural element like a door or window, I would first draw the element accurately using correct layers, line types, and real-world scale. Next, I would define a logical **base point** (such as the hinge side of a door) and use the **BLOCK** command to convert the selected geometry into a block. During block creation, I would add **attributes** (using ATTDEF) for key information like door number, size, material, or fire rating so the block can store data. If flexibility is needed, I would convert it into a **dynamic block** by adding parameters (like linear, rotation, or visibility) and actions to control width, swing direction, or opening type. Finally, I would test the block by inserting it in different scenarios, ensure attribute prompts work correctly, and save it to a standard library for reuse and consistency across drawings.",

      "answer": "In one project, a critical integration issue surfaced just days before a delivery deadline, when a dependent service started failing under production-level load. I took ownership by immediately investigating the root cause, coordinating with the relevant teams, and communicating the risk clearly to stakeholders so there were no surprises. After identifying a configuration mismatch and an inefficient retry mechanism, I implemented a fix, added safeguards, and arranged a focused round of testing to validate the solution. I also documented the incident and updated our deployment checklist to prevent recurrence. As a result, we met the deadline with a stable release and improved the system’s resilience going forward.",
